# Previewing the site locally (requires Ruby) 

If you'd like to the site locally (for example, in the process of proposing a change):

0. Make sure Git and Ruby are installed. 
1. Clone the project repository (`git clone https://github.com/dsworkshop/WDS2018`)
2. `cd` into the newly created directory (default `WDS2018`)
3. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies. This should work on Windows as well.
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server
5. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the theme
