# Previewing the theme locally

If you'd like to preview the theme locally (for example, in the process of proposing a change):

0. Make sure Git and Ruby are installed. 
1. Clone down the theme's repository (`git clone https://github.com/dsworkshop/WDS2018`)
2. `cd` into the theme's directory
3. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server
5. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the theme
