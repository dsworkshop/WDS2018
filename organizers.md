She has contributed and led over 20 national and European research projects and authored more than 100 scientific publications, and chaired the European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) in 2011 and 2012 and International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) in 2016. She was vice-president of STI International until 2016 and the director of the ESWC summer school series. She has co-chaired more than 15 workshops, including the series on Theory and Practice of Social Machines (SOCM) at WWW, Crowdsourcing the Semantic Web at ISWC and Ontology Engineering in a Data Driven World at EKAW.

**Prof. Oscar Corcho** is professor at Departamento de Inteligencia Artificial (Facultad de Informática , Universidad Politécnica de Madrid), and he co-leads the Ontology Engineering Group. His research activities are focused on Open Science, Open Data, Semantic Web and Ontological Engineering. In these areas, he has participated in a number of national and European research projects. Previously, he worked as a Marie Curie research fellow at the University of Manchester, and was a research manager at iSOCO. He holds a degree in Computer Science, an MSc in Software Engineering and a PhD in Computational Science and Artificial Intelligence from UPM. He was awarded the Third National Award by the Spanish Ministry of Education in 2001, and the Juan López de Peñalver Award by the Spanish Royal Society of Engineering in 2016. He has published several books, from which “Ontological Engineering” can be highlighted as it is being used as a reference book in a several university lectures worldwide, and more than 100 papers in journals, conferences and workshops. He usually participates in the organisation or in the programme committees of relevant international conferences and workshops.

**Dr. Vadim Savenkov** is a post-doc researcher in the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU). He did his PhD on the foundations of information integration in Vienna University of Technology (2012). His research spans various topics of data integration on the Web, including querying and updates in the Semantic Web context. He is running an Austrian research project CommuniData.at, which aims at increasing the accessibility of Open Data for the end users.

**Laura Koesten** is a Marie Curie Skłodowska fellow, doing her PhD at the Open Data Institute and at the University of Southampton in the UK. She is part of WDAqua, a European Union’s Horizon 2020 initiative to advance state of the art Question Answering. Her research interests are Human Computer Interaction, Interactive Information Retrieval with a focus on dataset retrieval, Open Data and and Semantic Interfaces. In her PhD she is looking at ways to improve Human Data Interaction in IIR systems. She publishes at CHI and CHIIR and has a background in Human Factors, with an MSc from Loughborough University.
